# Examples of Isomorphic Open Hypergraphs

Run:

    cargo run

This will generate a number of examples of isomorphic hypergraphs in `example_isomorphism` as a folder containing:

- `a.json`, `b.json`: JSON encoded isomorphic open hypergraphs
- `a.svg`, `b.svg`: SVG renderings of each open hypergraph, with nodes and hyperedges labeled with IDs.

To view examples, run

    python serve_examples.py

and navigate to [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).
